# P4-Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project implements a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance user interaction and provide intelligent, conversational responses. The chatbot identifies user intents and responds contextually using predefined data patterns and machine learning models.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
* Detects user intents, such as greetings, farewells, and inquiries, using NLP models.
* Generates dynamic responses based on user input patterns and trained data.
* Tracks and saves chat conversations for user reference.
* Utilizes modern Python libraries for NLP and machine learning integration.
* Interactive web interface powered by Streamlit for seamless user interaction.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
* Python: Core programming language for the chatbot logic.
* NLTK: Natural language processing toolkit for tokenization and intent recognition.
* Scikit-learn: For training and deploying machine learning models.
* Streamlit: Framework for creating an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
* JSON: To structure and store chatbot intents data.

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
* NLTK: For robust natural language processing capabilities.
* Scikit-learn: For powering machine learning workflows.
* Streamlit: For creating an intuitive user interface.
